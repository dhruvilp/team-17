Food Plate is a sustainability-focused web and mobile application aimed towards incentivizing young adults to learn to love the Earth. It is a partnership with Rare, a nonprofit that strives to teach humans how to be better to their planet. The focus of Food Plate is encouraging a shift towards a plant-based lifestyle. The app is a social driven, gamelike means to track the types of food consumed in a day. It emphasizes on impact by providing the user with a visual summary of the composition of their diet weekly. This is done in the hopes of encouraging users to reflect on their lifestyle and how they could improve it for the betterment of the Earth. The leaderboard/ranking effort was included to incite excitement in users to feel challenged to reach the goals and statistics of those around them. 

Dependencies include flask and flask-bootstrap. Please install before and then write "FLASK_APP=User.py flask run" to run the app.
